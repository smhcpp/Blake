- [ ] **Plugin Manager:** Load various plugins related to the compositor.
- [ ] **Modal Capability:** Implement app mode(insert), normal mode and command mode.
- [ ] **Keymap Manager:** Enable keymapping in different modes, including the option to have separate keymaps for each application.

- [ ] **Command Mode:** Change many behaviors of the compositor via simple commands instead of modifying many files.
  - *Example:* Add items to the status bar (like a Bluetooth manager) and set options for live changes versus saved changes.
  - *Example:* Add keyboards and set keyboard change keys.
